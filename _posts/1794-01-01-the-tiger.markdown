    Tiger Tiger, burning bright,<br />
    In the forests of the night;<br />
    What immortal hand or eye,<br />
    Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
  </p>
  <p>
    In what distant deeps or skies.<br />
    Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br />
    On what wings dare he aspire?<br />
    What the hand, dare seize the fire?
  </p>
  <p>
    And what shoulder, and what art,<br />
    Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br />
    And when thy heart began to beat,<br />
    What dread hand? and what dread feet?
  </p>
  <p>
    What the hammer? what the chain,<br />
    In what furnace was thy brain?<br />
    What the anvil? what dread grasp,<br />
    Dare its deadly terrors clasp!
  </p>
  <p>
    When the stars threw down their spears<br />
    And waterâ€™d heaven with their tears:<br />
    Did he smile his work to see?<br />
    Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
  </p>
  <p>
    Tiger Tiger burning bright,<br />
    In the forests of the night:<br />
    What immortal hand or eye,<br />
    Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
