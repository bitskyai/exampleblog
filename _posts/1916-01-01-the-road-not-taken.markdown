<section>
<span>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
</span><br/>
<span>
And sorry I could not travel both
</span><br/>
<span>
And be one traveler, long I stood
</span><br/>
<span>
And looked down one as far as I could
</span><br/>
<span>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
</span><br/><br/>
</section>

<section>
<span>
Then took the other, as just as fair,
</span><br/>
<span>
And having perhaps the better claim,
</span><br/>
<span>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
</span><br/>
<span>
Though as for that the passing there
</span><br/>
<span>
Had worn them really about the same,
</span><br/><br/>
</section>

<section>
<span>
And both that morning equally lay
</span><br/>
<span>
In leaves no step had trodden black.
</span><br/>
<span>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
</span><br/>
<span>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
</span><br/>
<span>
I doubted if I should ever come back.
</span><br/>
<span>
I shall be telling this with a sigh
</span><br/>
<span>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
</span><br/>
<span>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
</span><br/>
<span>
I took the one less traveled by,
</span><br/>
<span>
And that has made all the difference.
</span>
