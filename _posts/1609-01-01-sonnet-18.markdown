  <p>
    Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br />
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br />
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
    And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:<br />
    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
    And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;<br />
    And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br />
    By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm’d;<br />
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade<br />
    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br />
    Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br />
    When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st;<br />
    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br />
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
  </p>
