  <p>
    I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
    That floats on high o’er vales and hills,<br />
    When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
    A host, of golden daffodils;<br />
    Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
    Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
    And twinkle on the milky way,<br />
    They stretched in never-ending line<br />
    Along the margin of a bay:<br />
    Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
    Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The waves beside them danced; but they<br />
    Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br />
    A poet could not but be gay,<br />
    In such a jocund company:<br />
    I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br />
    What wealth the show to me had brought:
  </p>
  <p>
    For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
    In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
    They flash upon that inward eye<br />
    Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
    And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
    And dances with the daffodils.
  </p>
