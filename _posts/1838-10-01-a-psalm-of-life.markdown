 <p>
    Tell me not, in mournful numbers,<br />
    Life is but an empty dream!<br />
    For the soul is dead that slumbers,<br />
    And things are not what they seem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Life is real! Life is earnest!<br />
    And the grave is not its goal;<br />
    Dust thou art, to dust returnest,<br />
    Was not spoken of the soul.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,<br />
    Is our destined end or way;<br />
    But to act, that each tomorrow<br />
    Find us farther than today.
  </p>
  <p>
    Art is long, and Time is fleeting,<br />
    And our hearts, though stout and brave,<br />
    Still, like muffled drums, are beating<br />
    Funeral marches to the grave.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the world’s broad field of battle,<br />
    In the bivouac of Life,<br />
    Be not like dumb, driven cattle!<br />
    Be a hero in the strife!
  </p>
  <p>
    Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!<br />
    Let the dead Past bury its dead!<br />
    Act,—act in the living Present!<br />
    Heart within, and God o’erhead!
  </p>
  <p>
    Lives of great men all remind us<br />
    We can make our lives sublime,<br />
    And, departing, leave behind us<br />
    Footprints on the sands of time;—
  </p>
  <p>
    Footprints, that perhaps another,<br />
    Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,<br />
    A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,<br />
    Seeing, shall take heart again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us, then, be up and doing,<br />
    With a heart for any fate;<br />
    Still achieving, still pursuing,<br />
    Learn to labor and to wait.
  </p>
