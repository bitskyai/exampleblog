<section>
<span>
I met a traveler from an antique land
</span><br/>
<span>
Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
</span><br/>
<span>
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,
</span><br/>
<span>
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
</span><br/>
<span>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
</span><br/>
<span>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
</span><br/>
<span>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
</span><br/>
<span>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
</span><br/>
<span>
And on the pedestal these words appear:
</span><br/>
<span>
‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
</span><br/>
<span>
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’
</span><br/>
<span>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
</span><br/>
<span>
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
</span><br/>
<span>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
</span><br/>
