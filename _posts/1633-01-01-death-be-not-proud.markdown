  <p>
    Death, be not proud, though some have called thee<br />
    Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;<br />
    For those whom thou think’st thou dost overthrow<br />
    Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.<br />
    From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,<br />
    Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,<br />
    And soonest our best men with thee do go,<br />
    Rest of their bones, and soul’s delivery.<br />
    Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,<br />
    And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,<br />
    And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well<br />
    And better than thy stroke; why swell’st thou then?<br />
    One short sleep past, we wake eternally<br />
    And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.
  </p>
