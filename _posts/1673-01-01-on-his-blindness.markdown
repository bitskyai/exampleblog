<p>
    When I consider how my light is spent<br />
    Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,<br />
    And that one talent which is death to hide<br />
    Lodg’d with me useless, though my soul more bent<br />
    To serve therewith my Maker, and present<br />
    My true account, lest he returning chide,<br />
    “Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”<br />
    I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent<br />
    That murmur, soon replies: “God doth not need<br />
    Either man’s work or his own gifts: who best<br />
    Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state<br />
    Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed<br />
    And post o’er land and ocean without rest:<br />
    They also serve who only stand and wait.”
