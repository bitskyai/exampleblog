<span>
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
</span><br/>
<span>
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
</span><br/>
<span>
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
</span><br/>
<span>
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
</span><br/>
<span>
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
</span><br/>
<span>
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
</span><br/>
<span>
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
</span><br/>
<span>
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
</span><br/>
<span>
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
</span><br/>
<span>
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,
</span><br/>
<span>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
</span><br/>
<span>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
</span><br/>
<span>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
</span><br/>
<span>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
</span><br/>
